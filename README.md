# California-Airbnb-Big-Data



This project is a comprehensive data analytics exploration of Airbnb listings across multiple Californian cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and others. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights into the short-term rental market using data science and machine learning techniques. Data was obtained from Kaggle. 

Features
	•	Data Cleaning and Exploration: Merging, cleaning, and analyzing datasets of over 50,000 rows to ensure high-quality inputs for analysis.
	•	Sentiment Analysis: Understanding customer sentiments through Airbnb reviews using the AFINN model.
	•	Price Prediction Models: Using LSTM, GRU, and SimpleRNN neural networks for time series analysis and predicting listing prices.
	•	Regression Analysis: Employing linear, polynomial, and Lasso regression to identify significant factors affecting prices.
	•	Geographical Sentiment Mapping: Visualizing customer sentiments across California using color-coded maps.
	•	Most Popular Listings: Identifying the most reviewed Airbnb properties and analyzing their characteristics.

Tools and Techniques
	•	Programming Languages: Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow.
	•	Machine Learning Models:
	•	LSTM, GRU, and SimpleRNN for time series forecasting.
	•	Linear and Lasso regression for predictive modeling.
	•	Natural Language Processing: Using NLTK for text analysis and word tokenization.
	•	Visualization: Generating word clouds, time-series plots, and geographical sentiment maps.
	•	Dataset Sources: High-quality Airbnb datasets sourced from Kaggle, encompassing thousands of listings and reviews.

Key Insights
	•	Predictive models provided moderate accuracy, with GRU showing the lowest RMSE for price forecasting.
	•	Sentiment analysis revealed a positive skew in customer reviews, concentrated in popular locations like Los Angeles and San Francisco.
	•	Regression models highlighted significant predictors of listing prices, such as location and amenities.

This project showcases the application of big data and machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights from large-scale datasets, providing valuable information for stakeholders in the short-term rental market.
